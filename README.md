# SageCRMTerritoryOrdering
This code will order the territory list in Sage CRM alphabetically

This is the basic code to use for ordering the Territory list in CRM
There is a folder with a test code for JsFiddle -> https://jsfiddle.net/
Do not use the normal code as the CRM (crm) js object does not exist in JSFiddle

Code can be implemented into the js folder as the ready function is there to run when the page loads
Should work on all entities in Sage CRM
Standard code will not run in the admin screen as the field id = Terr_ParentID and does not end in *secterr

Completed this code with the help from stackoverflow
